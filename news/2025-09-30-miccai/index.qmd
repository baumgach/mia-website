This year, we presented the following papers at MICCAI.

Main conference papers:

- *[Prototype-Based Multiple Instance Learning for Gigapixel Whole Slide Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08384) by Susu Sun*. Susu developed an inherently interpretable MIL classifier for histopathology images that operates on concepts automatically discovered using a sparse autoencoder.  
- *[Mind the Detail: Uncovering Clinically Relevant Image Details in Accelerated MRI with Semantically Diverse Reconstructions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00670) by Jan Nikolas Morshuis*. Nikolas developed a method based on adversarial perturbations that enables MR reconstruction techniques to generate semantically diverse reconstructions, helping to reveal rare pathologies that might otherwise be missed.  
- *[Subgroup Performance Analysis in Hidden Stratifications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10382) by Alceu Bissoto and Lisa Koch from the [MLM Lab in Bern](https://www.mlm-lab.ch/)*. In this joint work, led by our colleagues at the University of Bern, we investigated whether subgroup discovery can serve as a tool for performance validation and monitoring in deep learning based medical diagnosis systems.  

[UNSURE workshop](https://unsuremiccai.github.io/) paper:  

- *[Is Uncertainty Quantification a Viable Alternative to Learned Deferral?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02319) by Anna M. Wundram*. In this paper, Anna investigated whether uncertainty quantification methods can be used to effectively defer medical decisions to human experts in both in-domain and out-of-domain settings.  

Outside of the conference, we also got to enjoy Korean culture including amazing Korean food. It was also a very special MICCAI for me, because I got to travel to Korea together with my family.
