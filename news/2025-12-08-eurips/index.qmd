Christian visited the first ever EurIPS conference in Copenhagen (1.12. - 8-12.2025) and was invited as a keynote speaker for the MedEurIPS workshop. He was talking about recent work by Susu Sun on [concept-based explanations for histopathology diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08384), and Paul Fischer on [uncertainty-guided MR acquisitions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14952).
