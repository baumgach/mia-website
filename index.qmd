We are a research group working on machine learning for healthcare, with the goal of enabling safer and more reliable clinical decision-making. Our work focuses on developing interpretable and uncertainty-aware learning methods that are robust to heterogeneous data and capable of generalizing across tasks and settings. Our research is informed by close collaboration with clinicians and domain experts to ensure that our methodological advances can ultimately translate into real clinical workflows.
