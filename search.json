    "text": "In medical image analysis, confidently predicting something false can have devastating consequences. Apart from achieving high predictive accuracy, one needs to establish the circumstances under which algorithmic predictions generalize, or give appropriate error bounds. This is highly relevant to patient safety and the regulation of machine learning based medical software. The goal in this branch, is develop deep learning methods founded in probability theory that can be used to estimate uncertainty stemming from sources such as the image reconstruction, or inherent limitations of an imaging modality."

    "text": "The rapid developments and early successes of deep learning technology in medical image analysis (and other fields) have caused the field to prioritize predictive accuracy over human integration. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that black box models are unlikely to find clinical acceptance, can lead to ethical problems when neither the patient nor the doctor understand the reasoning behind a prediction, and are difficult to certify. Our research goals in this branch are to develop adequate explanations for predictions of deep learning models, and perhaps more importantly, to build inherently interpretable models rooted in prior clinical knowledge."

Touching a hot pan’s lid provides a simple and all too familiar example of such thermal conduction. As a material’s size is reduced to 10-100s of nanometers, or about 1,000 times smaller than a human hair, depositing and maintaining thermal energy within a small region of space becomes even more challenging. Yet the ability to control heat flow and thus temperature at nanoscopic dimensions has important implications for applications ranging from data storage and local chemical reaction control to photothermal therapies for disease treatment and pain management through ion channel stimulation.\nWith support from the National Science Foundation Designing Materials to Revolutionize and Engineer our Future (DMREF) Program, Professor David J. Masiello from the University of Washington, Professor Katherine A. Willets from Temple University, and Professor Stephan Link from Rice University are developing methods to theoretically design and experimentally realize a new class of materials capable of controllably directing temperature increases to nanoscale regions of space using light. Beyond impacting a wide variety of applications, the project is also facilitating the interdisciplinary training of students and postdoctoral researchers through student exchange between the three research groups.",

    "text": "A major limitation of deep learning in many real-world applications is the scarcity of labelled data. Meta-learning, which leverages experience across related tasks to accelerate learning on new problems, has the potential to mitigate this data scarcity. However, most existing meta-learning methods are developed and evaluated under idealised assumptions, such as homogeneous task definitions, fixed data modalities, and well-defined training distributions.\nIn this research area, we study meta-learning as a foundation for building robust and adaptable machine-learning systems that transfer readily across tasks with only few training data points. Specifically, we focus on meta-learning methods that operate under realistic conditions, including heterogeneous tasks and varying label spaces."
