It is an essential tool for anyone aspiring to work with cutting-edge machine learning and data science technologies. In this course, students will learn to: - Set up Python on their personal computers. - Understand and use basic control structures and data types in Python. - Utilize key Python libraries for data analysis and visualization. - Train simple machine learning models. The course includes both lectures and hands-on practical sessions, allowing students to apply their newly acquired skills in real-world scenarios."

    "text": "Description\nMachine learning (ML) research is moving at a very rapid pace. Many of the recent developments in the automated analysis of images, text, as well as other data modalities has the potential to substantially reform healthcare. In this environment independently reading academic research papers, as well as a basic understanding of modern ML techniques are crucial. In this seminar, students will learn to read, understand, and present research paper on the topic of ML for healthcare. Each two hour session will see the presentation of some background by the instructor, as well as a student presentation on a applied ML for healthcare research paper, followed by a group discussion. Throughout, the semester we will go from simple applications of regression models, to more advanced techniques based on neural networks. Using the research papers as a red thread, we will see different medical data types (tabular data, text data, image data, time-series data), different modern ML tools (e.g. CNNs, Transformers, CLIP models) as well as different application areas of ML for health (data generation, risk stratification, decision support, workflow support, medical discovery)."

    "text": "A major limitation of deep learning in many real-world applications is the scarcity of labelled data. Meta-learning, which leverages experience across related tasks to accelerate learning on new problems, has the potential to mitigate this data scarcity. However, most existing meta-learning methods are developed and evaluated under idealised assumptions, such as homogeneous task definitions, fixed data modalities, and well-defined training distributions.\nIn this research area, we study meta-learning as a foundation for building robust and adaptable machine-learning systems that transfer readily across tasks with only few training data points. Specifically, we focus on meta-learning methods that operate under realistic conditions, including heterogeneous tasks and varying label spaces."

    "text": "Our research group works on applying artificial intelligence (AI) and data science to clinical data to improve patient outcomes, with a particular focus on medical image analysis. AI and data science can support medicine in several ways:\nMaking medical data analysis faster and more accessible, for example by partially automating diagnosis, outcome prediction, image quantification, and reconstruction.\nEnabling new clinical workflows that would not be feasible without AI support.\nExtracting insights from large datasets to guide treatment decisions, clinical research, and drug development.\nAlthough AI is widely used in areas such as voice assistance, content moderation, and fraud detection, its adoption in clinical practice remains limited. Healthcare is a high-stakes setting where methods must meet high standards of reliability and robustness. In addition, the black-box nature of many neural networks makes it difficult for clinicians to interpret results and explain decisions to patients. These issues also play a central role in regulatory and certification processes for medical AI.\nTo address this gap between machine learning and clinical practice, our group focuses on three main research directions: uncertainty quantification, interpretability, and methods that generalize across tasks."

    "text": "The rapid developments and early successes of deep learning technology in medical image analysis (and other fields) have caused the field to prioritize predictive accuracy over human integration. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that black box models are unlikely to find clinical acceptance, can lead to ethical problems when neither the patient nor the doctor understand the reasoning behind a prediction, and are difficult to certify. Our research goals in this branch are to develop adequate explanations for predictions of deep learning models, and perhaps more importantly, to build inherently interpretable models rooted in prior clinical knowledge."

    "text": "In medical image analysis, confidently predicting something false can have devastating consequences. Apart from achieving high predictive accuracy, one needs to establish the circumstances under which algorithmic predictions generalize, or give appropriate error bounds. This is highly relevant to patient safety and the regulation of machine learning based medical software. The goal in this branch, is develop deep learning methods founded in probability theory that can be used to estimate uncertainty stemming from sources such as the image reconstruction, or inherent limitations of an imaging modality."

They are increasingly important in healthcare, research, and industry applications. In this course, students will learn to:\n\nUse state-of-the-art LLMs through common interfaces such as Hugging Face, Google Gemini, and OpenAI.\nRun transformer-based models locally on their laptops and understand practical hardware considerations.\nApply LLMs to real-world healthcare tasks such as processing large text corpora, screening abstracts, classification, and summarization.\nWork with different model families, including BERT-like models, GPT-style models, and CLIP for multimodal tasks.\nDesign effective prompts and recognize common failure modes, biases, and ethical challenges of LLMs.\nBuild complete Python workflows that integrate LLMs into data analysis and machine-learning pipelines.\n\nThe course combines lectures with extensive hands-on exercises, enabling students to directly apply LLM-based methods to relevant healthcare examples."
